# Magic mirror lite

A simple react app for a magic mirror project. Since the raspberry pi zero w have limited resources there needs to be a small and simple app (not electron as the 'rea' Magic Mirror is written in).

There are some components to use, but are quite limited, feel free to fork and change as you wish.

- copy and change .env.example to .env and add weather-api-token

## Usage

To build .html and .js files
